In software development, the [“sprint”][sprint] is a term to describe a group of developers getting together with copious amounts of caffeine to focus on a 
specific programming task for a prolonged period of time, usually lasting a few days. During this time, the majority of time, energy, and focus are concentrated
on collaboration toward completing the main software development objective at hand. This marathon technique has served as an extremely effective tool in rapidly
creating software in a relatively concise period of time. 

I've wondered whether or not this technique would admit itself to a specialized area of research, specifically my area of interest, quantum complexity theory. 

Here were the ground rules which were abided by during our sprint:
1) 
2)
In short, this was a valuable learning experience, and interesting social experiment. If this post has sparked an interest, perhaps I can elaborate on some of the key concepts which I found most effective at structuring this research sprint:
1)
2)
