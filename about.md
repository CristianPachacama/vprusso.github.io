I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Waterloo's Institute for Quantum Computing under the supervision of professors [Michele Mosca](http://info.iqc.ca/mmosca/) and [John Watrous](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~watrous/). My research interests pertain to applications of semidefinite programming in quantum information and quantum complexity theory as well as quantum entanglement and non-locality.
