## A caveat to start

Before I begin, I'd like to confess that I've played guitar for the better part of 15 years or so. While the guitar and mandolin are different instruments to be sure, there are many similarities between both instruments that most likely give me an unfair advantage in picking up the mandolin. My ability to transfer the left and right-hand techniques from my guitar playing to mandolin playing give me an unfair advantage over someone who is just beginning on either instrument. 

Even if this is your first stringed instrument, I invite you to try something similar as well. It is surely possible to obtain a base level of proficiency in either guitar or mandolin given a brief allotment of time. Like so many things however, it is easy to learn, but hard to master. This post is about learning the fundamentals and getting to that base level of proficiency. I'm alloting myself 20 hours of dedicated practice of which I will elaborate on. My goal is to play in front of hundreds of people at the local farmers market and put my skill acquisition to the test. Onward! 

## The inspiration

I've been a big fan of <a href="http://tim.blog/podcast/">Tim Ferriss</a> for a long time, and one of his tenants in acquiring any type of skill is the so-called "minimum effective dose" approach to learning. That is, what are the building-block principles or absolute core ideas of the thing that I want to learn, and how can I focus on those few things that will provide me with the largest return. In essence, this is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto principle</a> or 80/20 rule which states "80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes". In other words, what is the 20% of mandolin skill that I need to acquire in order to achieve 80% of the desired effect? 

For a bit more inspiration here, you can also check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY">Josh Kaufman's TED talk</a>, entitled "The first 20 hours", where he puts theory into practice and learns the fundamentals of playing the ukelele in 20 hours of practice. 

I've found that when I was learning guitar, it was useful for me to know how high the ceiling of achievement for the instrument was by listening to some of the so-called guitar "top performers": The guitar players that pushed the instrument to its limits and really showed how versatile the instrument can be. Guitar players such as <a href="">Tosin Abasi</a>, <a href="">John Petrucci</a>, <a href="">Paul Gilbert</a>, and many others greatly inspired my own playing and gave me a window into what the outer limits of guitar playing looked like. 

For mandolin, one of the names I've seen pop up consistently is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Thile">Chris Thile</a>. Whether he's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloB_UecPno">playing Bach</a> or taking part in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7EcT5YzKhQ">NPR Tiny Desk concert with Yo Yo Ma</a>, he's pushing the little instrument to the furthest reaches of its capabilities. For the next 20 hours, Chris Thile will be the standard that I will be, incredibly far away from, but attempting to (very poorly) emulate. 

## DiSSS (Deconstruction, Selection, Sequencing, Stakes)

### Deconstruction - The minimum learnable units:

### Selection

### Sequencing

1) Stance: 
What is the proper way to hold the instrument? How does this change when I am sitting vs. standing? Etc.

2) Technique: 
What is the proper way to hold the pick? What is the proper picking technique? Strumming vs. playing individual notes, Etc.

3) Scales, chords, and arepeggios:
Memorize the most commond scales, chords, and arpeggio patterns. 

4) Master a repertoire of complete songs:

### Stakes
If I don't learn this well, I'll look like a fool in front of hundreds of people that I will most likely see each week at our local farmer's market. 

Here, I will focus on scales, chords, and arep


## CaFE (Compression, Frequency, Encoding)

### Compression (One page it)



### Frequency (When and how often)

### Encoding (Easy memorization)
